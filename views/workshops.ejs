<p> Artificial Intelligence refers to the machine intelligence. Machine learning is an application of artificial
    intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience
    without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer
    programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. This workshop equips you with the
    necessary skills required for the understanding of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.</p>

                            Automobile and Electric Vehicles Workshop mainly
focuses from Basics to Advanced concepts in Automobile Engineering. It covers chassis design, working of
Suspension unit, Steering System, Braking unit, Transmission, Fuel Supply System, IC Engine and Advanced
Technologies like ABS, EBD, DTS-Fi, MPFI, VVTI. All the concepts are explained in detail with the Help of
Theory and With Specially Designed Animations which would help students to visualize Things before
practically working on it.

                            Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices running
the Android operating system. Google states that "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java,
and C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also
possible. All non-JVM languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM
language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming
languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS).

                        <p>
                            Bridge design is one of the oldest subjects in civil engineering. This course deals with bridge substructure
systems, highlighting the more technical aspects of the design and rehabilitation of the bridge
substructure. Focusing on the components comprising and affecting bridge substructures, this course
addresses the different types of each component and discusses specific selection or design criteria, with a
focus on traditional and innovative practical solutions in professional applications. The main objective is to
present practical and economic methods of evaluation, inspection, reinforcement and rehabilitation of
bridges.
